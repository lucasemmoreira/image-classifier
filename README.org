* What is this?
  This is a simple start for an image classifier. It is strongly based on the tutorial from tensor flow ([[http:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/image_classification/overview][tensorflow image classification]]).

* Data
  In order to reproduce this code, you need data!
  The data I used, was from [[https:https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41][kaggle food]]. In order to do so, create a folder in root called data.
  The test made so far used only five classes of food from this data base, so to use the code to go, create a folder with the name food-5 inside the data folder.
  The structure you will have, will look like this:

  #+name:data structure
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  data
  | 
  + -- data
  | + -- food
  | | + -- all food labels
  | + -- food-5
  | | + -- five of the food labels
  #+END_SRC
